# JavaScript Practice & Revision

This is my personal repository where I practice JavaScript daily and document my learning journey. I'm working through core concepts, solving coding problems, and building a solid foundation in JavaScript fundamentals.

Every day, I pick a topic or problem to work on - whether it's understanding callbacks, mastering async patterns, or tackling algorithm challenges. Each topic gets its own folder with working code examples and a detailed README explaining the concepts in my own words.

This repository serves as both my learning playground and reference library. I write explanations like I'm teaching someone else, which helps me understand things better. No copy-pasting here - every example is written by hand, every README is from my own understanding.

The goal is simple: get better at JavaScript one day at a time, and have a collection of notes and examples I can come back to whenever I need a refresher.
